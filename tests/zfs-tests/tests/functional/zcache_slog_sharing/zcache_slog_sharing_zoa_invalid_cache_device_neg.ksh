# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify that the zfs-object-agent cannot be started with invalid zettacache
#	device name
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Get a list of devices that are available
#	2. Stop the zfs-object-agent and add the list of devices that were
#	   partitioned to be used as zettacache devices. Make sure we add only
#	   the basename of the device to ensure it is not correct
#	3. Start the zfs-object-agent
#	4. Verify from the object agent output that it is waiting for the devices to
#	   show up. It should eventually fail to start
#
